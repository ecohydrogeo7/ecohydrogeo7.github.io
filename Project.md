## Ridge and slough mosiac in Everglades, Florida
The research questions that I am asking are how to quantify landscapeâ€™s configuration, geometry and connectivity to explicitly link the vegetation pattern and carbon sequestration with hydrological modification. Developing pattern metrics and spectral metrics coupled with field observation (peat elevation differences), I identified early warning indicators of landscape transitions and evaluate the contemporary and historic spatial extent of healthy ridge-slough patterning in the Everglades, USA. One emphasis of my research is to analyze the interaction between ecosystem carbon cycle and hydrological processes interfaced with remote sensing (primarily satellite images) and Geographic Information System to better understand the mechanism and dynamics underlying wetland vegetation pattern and aid in the watershed management and restoration.

## Aquculture carrying capacity in coastal Maine
The overaching research question is what's the social carrying capacity of aquaculture in coastal Maine. Maine's pristine,rocky coastaline is attractive for amenity migration also ideal for fishery and aquaculture. I suspect gentrification/amenity migration affect the acceptence or resistance of aquaculture in Maine. I first seek the evidece of gentrification effect in coastal Maine by examining demographic and social-economic profiles of coastal Maine. The null hypothesis is no social economic difference between coastal and immediately inland community.
